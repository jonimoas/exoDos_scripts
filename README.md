# exoDos_scripts
helper scripts to manage the exodos package

parse.bat reads the directories that run the games and creates a bat file that calls said files. Useful if the frontend
is using single files for the games

launch_to_emustation.py python script that combines the two metadata xmls available and generates a gamelist.xml,
and downloading the images from launchbox.

The resulting files and layout are compatible with my frontend VBEmu and probably emulationstation
